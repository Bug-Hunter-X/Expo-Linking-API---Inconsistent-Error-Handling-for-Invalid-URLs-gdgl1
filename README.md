# Expo Linking API: Inconsistent Error Handling for Invalid URLs

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug issue when using Expo's `Linking` API to open URLs.  The problem stems from the API's inconsistent error handling when presented with invalid or inaccessible URLs.

## Problem
The `Linking.openURL()` method lacks robust error handling.  In cases where the URL is invalid or the resource is unavailable, the error message may be vague or nonexistent, making debugging challenging. This issue can easily lead to unexpected app behavior, particularly if error handling isn't implemented thoroughly.

## Solution
Implementing more comprehensive error handling is crucial.  This involves catching potential errors and providing informative messages to users.  Additionally, validating the URL before attempting to open it can help prevent many of these problems.

## Usage
The `bug.js` file showcases the issue; the `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved implementation with added error handling and URL validation.  Clone this repository and run both examples to see the difference in behavior.
